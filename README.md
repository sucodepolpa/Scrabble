This project determines the winner of a scrabble game based on user inputted words. Assigned on [CS50’s]((https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)) Week 2, Lab 2. Code works fine but after running a few tests other than the standard ones, there is one specific context in which it doesn't work and I haven't fixed it yet. Please do not use for reference as it is not yet complete!

In a game of Scrabble powered by a program written in C, the program would be responsible for managing and running the game according to the rules of Scrabble. This would include tasks such as:

1. **Initializing the game board**: The program would create the game board and read/process user input.

1. **Handling player turns**: The program would allow each player to take their turn by allowing them to type their words and score points. The program would also need to verify that the words being played are valid according to the ASCII table.

1. **Managing the score**: The program would need to keep track of the score for each player and update it.

1. **Handling game ending conditions**: The program would need to detect when the game has ended, then determine the winner and end the game.

Overall, the goal of the program would be to provide a smooth and enjoyable experience for players while accurately enforcing the rules of Scrabble.


[CS50]( https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) is Harvard University's course on introduction to computer science and programming.

**Scrabble** is a word game in which players use lettered tiles to create words on a game board. Each tile has a letter on it, and each letter is worth a certain number of points. Players take turns placing their tiles on the game board to create words, and the points they earn for each word are based on the values of the letters in the word and the premium squares on which the tiles are placed. The goal of the game is to earn the most points by creating the highest-scoring words. Scrabble is a popular game for people of all ages and can be played with two to four players.
