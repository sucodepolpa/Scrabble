# Scrabble
This project determines the winner of a scrabble game based on user inputted words. Assigned on CS50’s Week 2, Lab 2. Code works fine but after running a few tests other than the standart ones, there is one specific context in which it doesn't work and I haven't fixed it yet. Please do not use for reference as it is not yet complete!

(TO DO: fix "Oh, / hai!" bug)


[CS50]( https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) is Harvard University's course on introduction to computer science and programming.

[Scrabble]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) is a word game in which players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns and are included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.
